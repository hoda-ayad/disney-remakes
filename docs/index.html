    <h1><center>Prelim Concept - Does Disney Make Original Movies Anymore?</center></h1>
    <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
      <p>Aggregates movies produced by labels owned by the Walt Disney Company including information about the “originality” of each. The goal is to study the remake phenomenon on a small scale to determine if Disney (and potentially other studios) is actually relying more heavily on established properties than before.
      
      This data (see csv) is manually categorized at different levels of originality. </p>
      
      <h3>Labeling scheme</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>O  = Original</li>
        <li>A  = Adaptation</li>
        <li>A* = Adaptation (Debatable)</li>
        <li>S  = Sequel</li>
        <li>AS = Sequel of Adaptation</li>
        <li>R  = Reboot/Remake</li>
        <li>N  = NonFiction</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>NOTE: Limited to English-language fiction movies produced by one or more Disney-owned labels during Disney ownership. It will be important to define how much of a role the Disney label needs to have had in joint-produced films. This dataset can be expanded in the future to include other major film studios or TV shows.</p>
      
    <h2>Evaluating Pixar and Walt Disney Movies</h2>
    <p>Currently, Hollywood Pictures and Touchstone movies aren't completely labeled. 
These visualizations rely on Standard (Walt Disney Pictures) and Pixar, which together represent what a "Disney movie" is usually thought of as. This also excludes recently bought labels like Marvel and Lucasfilm.</p>

    <p>This is a lot of info! Here I've simplified the categories by marking labels: A* as A, AS as S, and N as O</p>

    <p>Using the same simplified labeling scheme, here we can observe the trend through proportions.</p>

    <h2>Investment in Other Labels</h2>
    <p>To better understand what labels Disney made movies under, we can observe how many movies each one produced over the years.</p>
