# Disney Movie Remakes Dataset

Aggregates movies produced by labels owned by the Walt Disney Company
including information about the "originality" of each. The goal is to
study the remake phenomenon on a small scale to determine if Disney (and
potentially other studios) is actually relying more heavily on
established properties than before.

## Scope

Limited to English-language fiction movies produced by one or more
Disney-owned labels during Disney ownership^[Walt Disney's current and former film production labels: Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures, Caravan Pictures, Miramax Films, Fox 2000 Pictures, 20th Digital Studio, Skellington Animation, Imagemovers Digital, BlueSky StudiosÂ ]. It will be important to
define how much of a role the Disney label needs to have had in
joint-produced films. This dataset can be expanded in the future to
include other major film studios or TV shows.
